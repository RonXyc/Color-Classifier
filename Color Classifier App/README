<<Real-Time Color Detection Web Application>>

This web application leverages computer vision techniques to detect and label various colors in real-time using a webcam. Built with Flask and OpenCV, it provides an intuitive interface for capturing and downloading images with detected colors.

<<Features>>

1. Real-time Color Detection: Processes video frames on-the-fly to identify and label colors.
2. Image Capture: Allows users to capture the current frame with detected colors.
3. Image Download: Provides an option to download the captured image for offline use.

<<Technologies Used>>

Frontend: HTML, CSS (Poppins font), JavaScript
Backend: Flask
Computer Vision: OpenCV, NumPy, PIL

<<Installation>>
